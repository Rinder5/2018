# CS3281&2 - 2018 Batch

This repo is mainly [information about the students in the module](students/studentlist.md), maintained by CS3281&2 students collectively.

## General Instructions for adding to this Repo

* Always use a new branch to add your content
* Do not force push
* No need to create issues or PRs

## Updating the Student List

* Update [`students/studentlist.md`](students/studentlist.md)
* Follow the example (in comments) at the top of the file
* Put all files related to you in a folder named `students/yourName` where `yourName` is real name (or part of your real name) e.g. `students/davidLim`

## Adding the Resume

* File name: `students/yourName/yourName.md`
* Why use markdown instead of PDF etc.?   
  > We require a text-based resume so that we can track the changes to it during the semester. Also, you should also have (even _prefer_) a text-based resume because some big companies (and head-hunting agencies) use text bots to process resumes.

* Length 1-2 pages. You may want to read up some online advice on writing good tech resumes. Write it as if you will use it for internship/job applications in the near future.

## Updating the Progress Page

* The progress page is [`students/progress.md`](students/progress.md).

## Updating the Process Observations Page

* Observations from the external projects are in [`students/processObservations.md`](students/processObservations.md).
