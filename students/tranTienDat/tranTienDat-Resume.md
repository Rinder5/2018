## Experience

### TEAMMATES (January 2018 - Present)
- Migrate the codebase of an online peer feedback platform to Java 8's date and time classes.
- Strenghten the app's security.

### Data Storage Institute, Singapore - Research Intern (May 2016 - July 2016)
- Research about Homomorphic encryption and its applicatin on storing and doing computation on data in the cloud.

### National University of Singapore - Teaching Assistant (August 2015 - December 2016)
- Use Pixi.js library to develop an immersive gamified online learning frontend with visual novel elements for the university's freshman introductory programming module CS1101S Programming Methodology.

## Expertise

### C++
- Implement a client and server for a homomorphically encrypted key-value store in C++ (2k LoCs). [Report here](implementation-simple-client.pdf). Propose and implement a new feature: add sorting capability to the key-value store. Used parallelization to speed up the operations.

### Security

- Web Security:
  - Discover Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Teammates and [fix](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/8609) it.
  - Assess the security of Teammates and make [recommendations](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/8797) to strengthen it.
  - Contribute to mitmproxy, an open source TLS-capable proxy to intercept HTTP traffic. [List of PRs](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pulls?q=author%3Atran-tien-dat).
  - Give a [talk](https://github.com/nus-cs3281/2018/files/1673112/CSRF.Presentation.pdf) and write a short [write-up](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/blob/master/contents/security/crossSiteRequestForgery/crossSiteRequestForgery.md) about Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
  - Give a [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AENTk3dFeL7KbKSolScNlsGh5g1udvVgDG2RFtNyaaM/edit?usp=sharing) about using "Find Security Bugs" static analysis tool.
- Cryptography:
  - Detailed understanding of Homomorphic Encryption.
- Software Security:
  - Able to read x86-64 assembly code compiled from C/C++ and write assembly exploits, return-oriented programming etc. Understand binary exploitation techniques and defenses (ASLR, PIE, StackGuard etc.) on Linux (i.e. ELF executables).

### Web Development: Java, Javascript, MySQL, HTML, CSS
- Contribute to Teammates, an online peer feedback platform with 250k users and 140k LoCs. [List of PRs](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pulls?q=author%3Atran-tien-dat)
