## Education

##### National University of Singapore (Aug 2015 - May 2019)
  * Bachelor of Computing (Honours) Computer Science
  * Honors (Highest Distinction) [Projected]
  * Focus Area: Algorithms and Theory, Artifical Intelligence

## Work Experiences

##### National University of Singapore (Teaching Assistant Aug 2017 - Current)
Teaching Assistant for Data Strutures and Algorithms module in NUS (CS2010, CS2040C)

  * Tutored 1 group of 18 students in CS2010 (Java) and currently tutoring
3 groups of students in CS2040C (C++) on various Data Structures and Algorithms.
  * Guiding students on their programming assignments, grading the assignments and 
giving feedback on their code.

##### DSO National Laboratries Intern (May 2017 - July 2017)
DSO National Laboratories (DSO) is Singaporeâ€™s largest defence 
research and development (R&D) organisation

  * Worked on a network profiler in C++, using network sniffing tools
such as tcpflow.

## Projects

#### mlpack
[mlpack](http://www.mlpack.org/) is a scalable machine learning library, written in C++ that provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale machine learning solutions.
  * Wrote missing tests for command-line and Python binds for mean shift method [#1289](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1289).
  * Resolved a bug in mean shift method [#1310](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1310).
  * Refactor code to use pass-by-value [#1315](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1315).

#### SE-EDU (Software Engineering - Education), AddressBook-Level 4
[AddressBook-Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4) is a Java application used to introduce NUS Computer Science students to best practices on Software Engineering.
  * Helped in reviewing new contributors and peer's PR
  * Resolved bug issues regarding undo/redo feature, storage layer and help window
  * Currently working on changing the undo/redo architecture to be easier for new students
  * Estimated contribution: 6 [PRs](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ayamidark+is%3Aclosed) merged, 800 LOC

##### TasKitty
[TasKitty](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W14-C4/main) is a desktop Task/Event application based on a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering.
  * Implemented features such as Undo/Redo and shortcut keys
  * Implemented tests for above implemented features, improved and fixed other tests
  * Gained familiarity of many software engineering aspects such as maintaining good code quality, continuous integration tools, software design patterns and testing
