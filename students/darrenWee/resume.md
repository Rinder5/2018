## Expert Areas
### Golang
- Delivered a talk on the features of Go and why you should learn Go ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gjksgaZ2RK6crbZvGWQLnlCu1PcDBox_IibqsZS6VmI/edit?usp=sharing))
- Worked on [`github/hub`](https://github.com/github/hub), a command-line utility that wraps around git on a terminal. `hub` is implemented in Go.
- Reviewed book chapter on introduction to Go ([chapter](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/blob/master/contents/go/Go.md))

### Git
- Delivered a talk on best practices with git ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wj9zmEKEnLbPzPz2Ifl7ZZcayJr6QjqfoJkt1zfwqpg/edit?usp=sharing))
- Wrote book chapter on git best practices ([link](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/blob/master/contents/revisionControl/bestPracticesGit.md))
- Worked on [`github/hub`](https://github.com/github/hub), a command-line utility that wraps around git on a terminal. Developing on `hub` requires a decent understanding of how git works.

## Projects
### Teammates

### VOGLBot/AndreaBot
A set of Telegram bots made for the University Scholars Program's freshmen orientation.

* VOGLBot makes handling attendance and participant information easy and less clunky by relying on commands issued via Telegram
* AndreaBot handles announcements via a single interface and allows for group-based announcements. (*at the time of development/deployment, Telegram did not have read-only channels*)
* Both bots implemented using python3 and mongodb
* Users would issue simple text commands to perform CRUD operations for orientation attendees
